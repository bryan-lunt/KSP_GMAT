##Automatically switched patched-conics in GMAT.
	GMAT is meant to do realistic N-Body simulations, it can and does to patched conics, but that is acheived by creating multiple propagators and having your script switch between them at the appropriate time. Would it be possible to create a plugin that would provide an automatically switching patched-conics propagator?
