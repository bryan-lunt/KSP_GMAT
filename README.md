# KSP_GMAT
Tools to allow the use of NASA's GMAT for Kerbal Space Program mission planning. Definitely overkill.

These tools will eventually make it possible to plan your KSP missions using NASA's GMAT tool. The first step is that we need GMAT to have the appropriate planets. Unfortunatley, this is not actually possible, as the 9 (yes, 9!) planets are hard-coded into GMAT. We cannot remove or rename them without altering the GMAT code.

The tools available at the moment gather ephemeris data from ksp and create ephemeris files that can be used with GMAT.
